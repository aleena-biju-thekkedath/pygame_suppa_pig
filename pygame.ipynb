    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppa Pig is a simple 2D game built using the Pygame library in Python. The game features a pig character that the player controls and obstacles that fall from the top of the screen. The objective of the game is to avoid the obstacles and collect pumpkins to score points. The game keeps track of your current score and your highscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To run and modify this game, you need to have the following installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3\n",
    "- Pygame library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Play\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the pig character.\n",
    "- Avoid the falling obstacles (fences) to stay in the game.\n",
    "- Collect pumpkins to increase your score.\n",
    "- The game ends when you collide with an obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pig character can move in all directions using the arrow keys.\n",
    "- Obstacles (fences) fall from the top of the screen at regular intervals.\n",
    "- The game keeps track of your current score and highscore.\n",
    "- If you beat your highscore, it will be updated and saved.\n",
    "- Press 'R' to restart the game after a game over.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highscore\n",
    "\n",
    "- The game stores your highscore in a text file called `highscore.txt`.\n",
    "- It loads the highscore at the start of the game.\n",
    "- If your current score surpasses your highscore, it will be updated and saved to the file.\n",
